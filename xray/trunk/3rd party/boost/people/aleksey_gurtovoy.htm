    <p>Aleksey Gurtovoy is just a one Russian guy from Siberia, who now lives and 
      works in the United States. He is a technical lead in a small software company <a href="http://www.meta-comm.com">
        MetaCommunications</a>, a job and people which have taught him so much.</p>
    <p>He was born in early 1977, has been in love with computers since 1989, and 
      still has a lot of (exciting) ideas for his &quot;spare time&quot; in the next 
      few years. The first computer he worked with was DEC PDP-11, and he still has a 
      kind of nostalgia about this amazing machine. He graduated with honors from 
      Krasnoyarsk Technical State University in 1998 with a Master Degree in Computer 
      Science.</p>
    <p>While being acknowledged as a talented programmer, Aleksey tries to be a 
      better engineer than he is now and hopes that reading good books will help him 
      with that task. He reads a lot... One of his favorite books about his 
      profession is 'The Mythical Man-Month' by Frederic P. Brooks, Jr.</p>
    <p>He has been working with C++ since 1993, he loves the language and wants to be 
      involved in its progress. Sometimes you can come across his articles in the <a href="news:comp.lang.c++.moderated">
        comp.lang.c++.moderated</a> and <a href="news:comp.std.c++">comp.std.c++</a><a>
      newsgroups. The other numerous things Aleksey is interested in include 
      patterns, object-oriented methodology and programming languages, organization 
      of software development process and tools &amp; technologies which make 
      programmer's life easier (e.g. compilers).</p>
    <p>He is not married, but he has in mind one great girl he hopes to be with 
      someday.</p>
