      Kevlin Henney (<a href="mailto:kevlin@curbralan.com">mailto:kevlin@curbralan.com</a>,
      <a href="http://www.curbralan.com">http://www.curbralan.com</a>) is an 
      independent consultant and trainer based in the UK. He has developed and 
      delivered training course material and consultancy on many aspects of OO 
      development, which he has practiced across a number of domains for longer than 
      he cares (or can) remember. His professional interests include patterns, OO and 
      component-based design, architecture, distributed object systems, and 
      languages, including C++, C#, Java, and Ruby. He is also a member of the BSI 
      C++ standards committee.
    </p>
    <p>Now that writing code is no longer the core responsibility of his job, his 
      non-professional interests seem to include the hacking associated with the 
      aforementioned professional interests. However, never being one to keep 
      something to himself (like C++'s relationship with C, this is regarded as both 
      a strength and a weakness), he shares/inflicts (delete as necessary) his 
      professional and non-professional development experiences with/on (ditto) 
      others through writing articles and presenting tutorials, workshops and papers 
      at conferences.</p>
    <p>He is married, and not just to his work. He and Carolyn have one child, 
      Stefan. The little spare time that remains to him is taken up with music, 
      reading, pub appreciation, etc. Although with a newborn, there is more reading 
      and less pub appreciation (pubs are still appreciated, but more in memory than 
      in interaction).&nbsp; Finally, although he enjoys writing, Kevlin is not 
      really one for writing in the third person.</p>
