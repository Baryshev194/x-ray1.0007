    Ed Brey lives in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, a village outside of Milwaukee. In 
    the summertime, he likes to play tennis with his wife, and in the winter, if 
    there is enough snow, he likes to go tobogganing or ice-skating. If it is not 
    nice enough outside for either of those, he plays on the piano.
    <p>Ed works at <a href="http://www.eaton.com">Eaton Corporation</a> in Milwaukee. 
      He started working there as part of <a href="http://www.mu.edu">Marquette 
        University</a>'s engineering co-op program. Upon graduation in 1995 from 
      Marquette with a BS in electrical and computer engineering, he was hired on 
      full-time, where he initially worked on firmware for industrial controls. More 
      recently, he has been working on a PC-based configuration tool for industrial 
      networks. Ed received his MS in computer engineering in 2001 from <a href="http://www.ntu.edu">
        NTU</a>
    .
    <p>
    Ed has held programming as a pastime since his grade school days, when he wrote 
    a babysitting invoicing program. Soon after, he wrote a game inspired by the TV 
    game show &ldquo;Press Your Luck&rdquo;. Ever since, programming languages and 
    concepts, along with finding ways to improve the art and science of coding 
    software, have always peeked his interest.
    <p>Lastly, Ed has managed to retain his perspective. As fun as computers and 
      programming are, Ed's true loves in life are the Lord Jesus whom he serves and 
      his dear wife Beth.</p>
