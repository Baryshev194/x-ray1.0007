      Marcus is a senior computer scientist in the Advanced Technology Group at Adobe 
      Systems, Inc. He has been developing software since 1985. In the summer of 
      2000, during a camping trip on the Washington coast, he read Czarnecki and 
      Eisenecker's seminal &quot;Generative Programming&quot; book. This opened up a 
      world of development possibilities beyond objects for him, and he hasn't looked 
      back. His first contribution to Boost followed soon afterwards; he discovered a 
      way to exploit the properties of the sizeof operator to simulate partial 
      specialization (is_pointer, etc. with Jesse Jones).

    <p>A mathematician by training, Mat is amused by abstraction. In his spare 
      professional time he is studying algebraic specification, category theory, and 
      philosophy in the hopes of someday understanding and exploiting the deep 
      answers to the question &quot;What is a type?&quot;. He is currently active as 
      Adobe's principal representative on the ANSI/ISO C++ committee. Mat also enjoys 
      ultimate frisbee, go, bodysurfing, and camping with his family. But above all, 
      he likes to laugh.</p>
    <p>Mat lives in Seattle with his wife and young son (shown in large photo).
