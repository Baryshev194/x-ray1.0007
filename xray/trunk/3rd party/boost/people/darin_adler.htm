      Adler has been programming computers since 1976. He loves to do it.</p>
    <p>His first major professional experience was at <a href="http://apple.com">Apple 
        Computer</a>. In 1988 he led the team that rewrote the Macintosh Finder in 
      C++. Before that project was completed, he was shanghaied to be the technical 
      lead for the System 7 project (these days they would call it &quot;Mac OS 
      7&quot;). The group he formed to help him do that, the Blue Meanies, is still a <a href="http://www.spies.com/~greg/bluemeanies.html">
        legend</a> in the Apple community.</p>
    <p>Since Apple, Darin has worked at <a href="http://www.generalmagic.com">General 
        Magic</a> as an architect of the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Magic+Cap">
        Magic Cap</a> OS, used the moniker <a href="http://bentspoon.com">Bent Spoon 
        Software</a> to do consulting, and helped start Eazel, a company that worked 
      to make Linux easier to use and developed the Nautilus graphical shell for <a href="http://www.gnome.org">
        GNOME</a>. Since 1997, he has worked from his home in Los Angeles, CA, 
      collaborating with clients and coworkers in other locations.</p>
    <p>He prefers to use and program Macintosh computers with C++. But work on the 
      GNOME project is best accomplished with a non-Macintosh PC. (That's why Darin 
      is sitting in front of <a href="darin_adler.jpg">two computers</a>.) The other 
      people working on the GNOME project don't like C++, so he's writing a lot of C 
      code these days.</p>
    <p>The <a href="darin_adler.jpg">larger version</a> of his picture shows him hard 
      at work with his C++ guru, his daughter Sophia.</p>
    <p>He has hobbies and stuff but you don't want to read about that here.</p>
