      Ralf is a crystallographer. He has a degree in Mineralogy (<a href="http://www.mineralogie.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/englisch/mineralogie_v2.0_eng.htm">Bochum, 
        Germany</a>), and a Ph.D. in Crystallography (<a href="http://www.kristall.ethz.ch/LFK/">ETH 
        Zurich</a>
    , Switzerland). Real Mineralogists and Crystallographers run experiments with 
    x-rays and hardware that is not normally associated with C++ and Boost. 
    However, when Ralf kept breaking the expensive experimental equipment too 
    often, he decided that he would cause less damage as a computational 
    crystallographer.
    <p>
      Being a scientist, Ralf spent most of his life programming in Fortran, the 
      great grand-father of all good programming languages (if you know Backus-Naur 
      you know the name of the <a href="http://www.digitalcentury.com/encyclo/update/backus.html">
        inventor of Fortran</a>). Ralf is a co-author of the <a href="http://cns.csb.yale.edu/">
        CNS</a> Fortran program that is very popular in structural biology. When he 
      learned that a real programmer can write Fortran in any language, Ralf knew 
      that it was time for him to learn C++. Of course, absorbing four decades of 
      progress in the field of computer science all at once crashed his brain. To be 
      able to deal with the challenge, he spawned two child processes and named them 
      Lisa and Anna. To see Lisa, click on the picture and turn your monitor by 180 
      degrees around the view axis. (Other pictures of <a href="http://cci.lbl.gov/~rwgk/Lisa-Roza-Illes/">
        Lisa</a> and <a href="http://cci.lbl.gov/~rwgk/Anna-Rhona-Illes/">Anna</a>
    do not require gymnastics with the monitor.)
    <p>
      Right now, Ralf is working for the <a href="http://cci.lbl.gov/">Computational 
        Crystallography Initiative</a> at the <a href="http://www.lbl.gov/">Lawrence 
        Berkeley National Laboratory</a> in California. The goal of this initiative 
      is to write a software system for high-throughput protein crystal structure 
      determination, also known as <a href="http://www.nigms.nih.gov/news/announcements/psi.html">
        Structural Genomics</a>. Surprisingly, the gestation period for such a system 
      turns out to be much longer than it was for Lisa and Anna. However, pre-natal 
      diagnosis already revealed that Python and C++ are the parents-to-be. For an 
      ultra-sound image of the new system at its early developmental stage <a href="http://cctbx.sourceforge.net/">
