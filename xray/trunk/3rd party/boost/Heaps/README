Boost Priority Queues
=====================

CONTENTS
  This directory contains the Boost priority queue page, providing
  several templates implementing different priority queues.

  For information on the use of the various classes, please refer to
  the documentation in the directory doc/html or doc/man/man3. For more
  information on the Boost library see <http://www.boost.org/>

INSTALLATION
  This package consists of a several template classes, the corresponding
  documentation, and some test cases. However, there is nothing which
  needs to be compiled, except the test cases if you want to test the
  installation.

  To install this package, you should copy the directory "boost"
  and the files it contains into a directory where the C++ compiler
  looks for header files. For example, on UNIX systems /usr/include
  or /usr/local/include are reasonable choices. Alternatively you can
  put the files in some arbitrary location and set up your projects or
  makefiles to search this directory.

  The directory doc/html contains documentation in html format. You
  could create a link to the corresponding index.html and put the
  files into an appropriate location. Correspondingly, the directoy
  doc/man/man3 contains UNIX man pages. To use these, you can either
  install them into a directory in you MAN_PATH or setup your
  MAN_PATH to search the directory you choose to install the files.
  Note, that the html and roff documentation is created from the
  same source format. Thus, there is identical information in both
  version (well, except that the HTML version contains a lot of
  hyperlinks).

VERSION heap-1.0
  If you have problem reports or questions please specify this version
  number to make it easier to track down the problem.
