  <A NAME="Note"><H1>Note</H1></A>

    The current implementation is basically <B>useless</B> because the
    interesting operations are not implemented at all and some of the
    implemented operations, notably <nobr><tt>push()</tt></nobr> make unrealistic
    assumptions! In the case of <nobr><tt>push()</tt></nobr> it is assumed that no
    element was removed from the heap making this heap only useful
    for cases where <nobr><tt>std::sort()</tt></nobr> could be used as well (and
    sorting is much faster). However, I'm sure that the interface can
    be kept when the code is corrected.
  
  <A NAME="Description"><H1>Description</H1></A>

    The Radix heap cannot be used for general elements because as part
    of its approach it is restricted to integral types. Also, it is hard
    to understand the behavior of this approach when using fast access
    to the largest element. Although the default behavior of this implementation
    will provide access to the element with the largest priority, the
    smallest priority is used for the following description...

    <P>


    Apart from the restriction on integral types, there is another restriction
    for the Radix heap, namely that elements cannot be decreased beyond the
    minimum value currently stored in the heap. A priority queue like this
    is suitable only in very specific cases but eg. Dijkstra's algorithm
    to find the shortest paths in a graph is one such application. In turn
    a radix heap seems to be significantly faster (however, I can't really
    tell because the current implementation has to be changed to implement
    the missing operations).

    <P>


    The Radix heap maintains a set of buckets and objects with different
    priority can end up in different buckets. To avoid excessive search for
    the minimum element, elements are redistributed into unused buckets.
    Each bucket is assigned a range of elements stored in the bucket where
    the smaller elements end up in buckets with narrow ranges: Initially,
    the ranges for the buckets are <I>0..0</I>, <I>1..1</I>,
    <I>2..3</I>, <I>4..7</I>, <I>8..15</I>, and so on. Thus,
    the correct bucket can be found by determining the radix of the
    integral value. Now, when elements are removed from the heap, the
    first buckets become unused and the heap has to search larger buckets
    for the minium element. If it has found a bucket with multiple different
    elements, the heap knows that the smaller buckets are not used. Thus,
    the elements in the found bucket are redistributed into the unused
    buckets.
    
    <P>


    The only description of the Radix heap I have currently available (from
    <I>Network Flows</I>, Ahuja, Magnanti, Orlin, Prentice Hall) is
    somewhat silent about the details of the operation. Thus, I haven't
    implemented some of the operations. Also, it probably does not work
    to insert an element after there are elements extracted from the
    heap... 

    <P>


    This class does not use a comparator function. Instead, it uses a
    traits class which is used to determine the radix of the elements.
    Actually, the traits class has three members:
    <DL>
<DT>
<nobr><tt>bits</tt></nobr>
<DD>
 This is used as constant expression to determine
                      the number of buckets to be used. This is the
                      maximum value which can be returned from
		      <nobr><tt>radix()</tt></nobr> plus <I>1</I>.
<DT>
<nobr><tt>value(val)</tt></nobr>
<DD>
 This function returns an unsigned integral
                            value representing the priority of <nobr><tt>val</tt></nobr>.
                            This value is used as an offset passed
                            to the <nobr><tt>radix()</tt></nobr> function. This value
                            could in principle be used to determine the
                            radix but I think that it might be possible
                            provide better function determining the
			    radix than the default one... 
<DT>
<nobr><tt>radix(val, offset)</tt></nobr>
<DD>
 This function returns the radix
		      of the priority of <nobr><tt>val</tt></nobr> minus the offset
		      <nobr><tt>offset</tt></nobr>. 
</DL>


    The default traits use a static cast to <nobr><tt>unsigned long</tt></nobr> to
    determine the priority of <nobr><tt>val</tt></nobr>. To cope with the problem that
    the other priority queues access the largest element first, the
    value actually used is (well, should be...)
    <nobr><tt>std::numeric_limits&lt;unsigned long&gt;::max() - val</tt></nobr>.

    <P>


    For a description of the methods of <nobr><tt>radix_heap&lt;T, traits&gt;</tt></nobr> see the
    description of <A HREF="heap-common.html">common methods</A>. However, keep
    in mind that the current implementation does not implement all methods
    and some methods are probably unstable.
  
  <A NAME="Bugs"><H1>Bugs</H1></A>

    Some of the methods are not yet implemented and other methods are
    probably buggy. However, I have to work on other stuff and need to
    get the priority queue off my desk. If you really want to use this
    class or if you have an idea how to implement the missing methods
    please contact me. Maybe we can work out how to implement the missing
    stuff. A paper describing Radix heaps would probably also help...
