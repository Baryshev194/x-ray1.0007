<H1>Priority Queue sample</H1>

  <A NAME="Introduction"><H1>Introduction</H1></A>

    Well, a sample for priority queues is somewhat hard if it goes beyond
    something like heap sort which is not at all interesting because it
    only uses features already present in the template class
    <nobr><tt>std::priority_queue</tt></nobr>. OK, for starters, there is an implementation
    of heap sort below. A more realistic application of heap sort, namely
    Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest paths, is demonstrated below.
  
  <A NAME="Heap Sort"><H1>Heap Sort</H1></A>

    Here is a template implementation of heap sort taking the priority
    queue class to be used as template argument and sorting a range
    passed to the function:
   
    <P>

    <TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 COLS=2>
<TR><TD WIDTH=30 VALIGN=TOP></TD><TD>
<PRE>
template &lt;typename Heap, typename ForwardIterator&gt;
void heap_sort(ForwardIterator begin, ForwardIterator end)
{
  Heap heap; // use <A HREF="heap-common.html#default-ctor">default constructor</A> for construction

  // insert all elements into the heap:
  for (ForwardIterator it = begin; it != end; ++it)
    heap.<A HREF="heap-common.html#push">push</A>(*it); 

  // finally, extract them again:
  for (ForwardIterator it = begin; !heap.<A HREF="heap-common.html#empty">empty</A>(); ++it)
    {
      *it = heap.<A HREF="heap-common.html#top">top</A>();
      heap.<A HREF="heap-common.html#pop">pop</A>();
    }
}
    </PRE></TD></TABLE>


    Doesn't look to complicate, does it? First, all elements are inserted into
    the heap constructed by this function. This builds up some data structure
    internal to the heap which will allow efficient extraction of the maximum
    element (by default, the maximum is used; of course, this can be changed
    easily by just inverting the comparison). Thus, after all elements are
    inserted are stored in the priority queue, they are simply extracted after
    recording the current top element.

    <P>


    To complete this first example, here is a simple program which sorts
    a bunch of random numbers (to get reproducible results, always the
    same seed is used) using the algorithm selected by a program argument.
    Finally, the sorted numbers are printed.

    This program looks huge but only because there are some things repeated
    several times: It would be absolutely sufficient to have just one
    call to <nobr><tt>heap_sort()</tt></nobr> which uses an appropriate priority queue.
    Using this program, you can select which priority queue is to be used
    for sorting. If you change the constant determining the number of elements
    (current 20) and remove the output statement at the end of the program,
    you can use this program to profile the heaps for the use in heap sort.
    Of course, this is not really interesting since <nobr><tt>std::sort()</tt></nobr> does
    the same job much faster than any of those attempts (if it does not, you
    should complain at your library vendor...). On the other, it can give
    you a first feeling how the priority queues differ in their performance.

    <P>


    In this example, the comparator type was spelled out explicitly although
    this is not always necessary: By default, <nobr><tt>std::less&lt;T&gt;</tt></nobr> is used
    where <nobr><tt>T</tt></nobr> is the elment type of the priority queue. This default
    will result in extracting the largest value from the priority queue.
    In the example above, the type <nobr><tt>std::greater&lt;int&gt;</tt></nobr> was used for
    in some cases which has the effect that the smalllest value is obtained
    with the <nobr><tt><A HREF="heap-common.html#top">top</A>()</tt></nobr> method. Thus, the
    program should print the values in decending order for an even argument
    and in ascending order for an odd argument.

    <P>


    This example can be found in the file sample/heapsort.cc.
  
  <A NAME="Dijkstra's Algorithm"><H1>Dijkstra's Algorithm</H1></A>

    It was already mentioned in the previous section, a use like heap sort
    is quite unlike like for priority queues. It is more likely that they
    are used in setting where elements are extracted before all elements
    are known like eg. in certain scheduling applications where tasks are
    added to the priority queue and the most urgent one is extracted if
    there is time to start a new task. This would, however, not present
    any new methods compared to the heap sort example. Only the order
    in which the operations occur would be different.

    <P>


    When thinking of an application of priority queues, Dijkstra's algorithm
    to find shortest paths in graphs come immediately to my mind, probably
    due to my background. This algorithm works very simple: Initially, all
    nodes get an infinite distance except the start node (or the start nodes)
    which gets a zero distance, of course. All nodes are initially put
    into a priority queue. Then the algorithm executes a simple loop until
    the priority queue is empty:
    <UL>
<LI>

      Extract the node with the minimum distance from the priority queue.
      This node is the current node for this iteration.
      
<LI>

      For each adjacent node determine whether it's current distance is
      bigger than the distance of the current node plus the length of
      the edge to this node. If it is not, update the adjacent node to
      the distance of the current node plus the length of the edge. This
      decreases this node's priority.
    
</UL>


    That's all. It is relatively simple to see why this algorithm works
    but I'm not going into such details here (see eg. <I>Network
    Flows</I>, R.K.Ahuja, T.L.Magnanti, J.B.Orlin, Prentice Hall, for
    details). It would also some inappropriate to present this example
    on some graph class since this would require some graph class...
    Instead, I will use some sort of implicit graph for this example:
    You probably know this game where two words of the same length are
    given and the objective is to find the shortest sequence of one
    letter changes to reach one word from the other. Of course, the
    intermediate words have to be from some appropriate language, eg.
    the English language. Since it does not need a priority queue to
    solve this problem (a queue to implement Breadth First Search is
    sufficient), I will present a program which solves a variation on
    this game: It is allowed to change more than one letter at a
    time but the edge costs grows quadratic with the number of letters
    changed. The point of this is that the corresponding graph
    structure and the distance between nodes can easily be represented:
    The graph representation consists of words for the nodes and the
    edge distance is the number of letters differing between the two
    words squared.
    
    <P>


    For the use in Dijkstra's algorithm, each word is associated with two
    numbers, namely it's current distance (initially <nobr><tt>INT_MAX</tt></nobr>)
    and the index of the word from which it received it's minimal
    distance. The function <nobr><tt>dijkstra()</tt></nobr> which determines the
    shortest path gets two random access iterators are argument which
    provide access to a sequence of strings describing the dictionary
    to be used. In additino the indices of the start and the destintion
    nodes are passed as argument.  For simplicity, this function just
    prints the found path. Like in the heap sort example, the priority
    queue to be used is a template argument for this function.

    <P>


    The first part is a function which determines the distance between
    two nodes, that is the square of the number of characters
    differing in the corresponding two strings. Since the nodes are
    not represented by a special struct, this function just takes
   two strings are argument:

    <P>

    <TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 COLS=2>
<TR><TD WIDTH=30 VALIGN=TOP></TD><TD>
<PRE>
int node_distance(std::string const& s1, std::string const& s2)
{
  int count = 0;
  for (std::string::size_type i = 0; i &lt; s1.size(); ++i)
    if (s1[i] != s2[i])
      ++count;

  return count * count;
}
    </PRE></TD></TABLE>


    Since it is not possible to determine which node is detected from
    the distance of the node, it is necessary to store the distance
    and an identification which node corresponds to the element in
    the elements put into the node. Thus, the priority queue stores
    a struct made up of two elements, the index of the node and
    the distance. For this struct, <nobr><tt>operator&lt;()</tt></nobr> is overloaded
    to return <nobr><tt>true</tt></nobr> if the distance of the first argument is
    <B>larger</B> than the distance of the second argument. This
    operator is defined this way because the priority queue provides
    access to the largest element but the smallest element is needed.

    <P>


    There is another important aspect to be noted about this struct:
    It has an overloaded assignment operator which only assigns the
    distance but does not touch the index. This is done such that it
    is possible to change the priority without having to provide an
    where the index is set to the correct index. Although this would
    be easily possible in this case, it is not always possible in
    applications of priority queues. This approach can be used because
    the methods changing the priority of a node are member templates
    of the priority classes. These are guaranteed to use the assignment
    operator to change the value of an element.

    <P>

    <TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 COLS=2>
<TR><TD WIDTH=30 VALIGN=TOP></TD><TD>
<PRE>
struct node_ptr
{
  int index;    // index of the string
  int distance; // current distance

  explicit node_ptr(int idx): index(idx), distance(INT_MAX) {}
  void operator= (int dist) { distance = dist; }

  bool operator&lt; (node_ptr const& np) const { return distance &gt; np.distance; }
};
    </PRE></TD></TABLE>


    It is likely that structures like this are used as the element type
    of priority queues if it necessary to change the priorities and to
    identify objects using the elements stored in a priority queue.
 
    <P>


    Now everything is prepared for the actual implementation of the
    algorithm. The function <nobr><tt>dijkstra()</tt></nobr> maintains three <nobr><tt>std::vector</tt></nobr>s
    to keep track of some node information, name an array for the current distances
    which records a copy of the distance given as priority to the elements in the
    priority queue, an array recording the [current] predecessors of nodes,
    and an array storing "pointers" into the priority queue. These "pointer"
    are used as opaque values by the user of a priority queue. However, the
    priority queue uses these values to efficiently find the corresponding
    objects in the priority queue when the priority of an object is to be modified.
    <P>

    What is missing to complete the example is a <nobr><tt>main()</tt></nobr> which calls this
    function. Here is an example:

    <P>

    <TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 COLS=2>
<TR><TD WIDTH=30 VALIGN=TOP></TD><TD>
<PRE>
template &lt;typename T, int sz&gt; inline int size(T (&)[sz]) { return sz; }
template &lt;typename T, int sz&gt; inline T* begin(T (&array)[sz]) { return array; }
template &lt;typename T, int sz&gt; inline T* end(T (&array)[sz]) { return array + sz; }

int main()
{
  std::string nodes = { "heap", "help", "hold", "cold", "bold", "bolt", "boot" };

  dijkstra&lt;<A HREF="s_heap.html">boost::splay_heap</A>&gt;(begin(nodes), end(nodes), 0, size(nodes) - 1);
  dijkstra&lt;<A HREF="d_heap.html">boost::d_heap</A>&gt;(begin(nodes), end(nodes), 0, size(nodes) - 1);
  dijkstra&lt;<A HREF="f_heap.html">boost::fibonacci_heap</A>&gt;(begin(nodes), end(nodes), 0, size(nodes) - 1);
  dijkstra&lt;<A HREF="l_heap.html">boost::lazy_fibonacci_heap</A>&gt;(begin(nodes), end(nodes), 0, size(nodes) - 1);
  dijkstra&lt;<A HREF="p_heap.html">boost::pairing_heap</A>&gt;(begin(nodes), end(nodes), 0, size(nodes) - 1);
}
    </PRE></TD></TABLE>


    Since the function <nobr><tt>dijkstra()</tt></nobr> gets the type of the priority to be used
    as template template argument it is not necessary and actually also not possible
    to specify any of the template arguments. Just the name of the template class
    is passed in. To deal with the size of the array containing the strings for
    the nodes, a little trick is used: There are template functions <nobr><tt>begin()</tt></nobr>,
    <nobr><tt>end()</tt></nobr>, and <nobr><tt>size()</tt></nobr> which provide iterator like access to the
    statically sized array <nobr><tt>nodes</tt></nobr>.

    <P>


    The complete example can be found in sample/dijkstra.cc.
