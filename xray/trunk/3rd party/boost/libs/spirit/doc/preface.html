<p><b>History</b></p>
<p>A decade and a half ago, I wrote my first calculator in Pascal. For me, it 
  is one of the most unforgettable coding experience that I ever had. I was amazed 
  how a mutually recursive set of functions can model a grammar specification. 
  In time, the skills I acquired from that academic experience became quite useful. 
  Every now and then I was tasked to do some parsing. For instance, whenever I 
  need to perform any form of I/O, even in binary, I try to approach the task 
  somewhat formally by writing a grammar using Pascal-like syntax diagrams and 
  then write a corresponding recursive-descent parser. This worked very well.</p>
<p>The advent of the Internet and the World Wide Web magnified this a thousand-fold.
  At one point I had to write an HTML parser for a Web browser project. 
  I got a recursive-descent HTML parser working based on the W3C formal specifications 
  quite easily. I was certainly glad that HTML had a formal grammar specification. 
  Because of the influence of the Internet, I then had to do more parsing. RFC 
  specifications were everywhere. SGML, HTML, XML, even email addresses and those 
  seemingly trivial URLs were all formally specified using small EBNF-style grammar 
  specifications. This made me wish for a tool similar to big-time parser generators 
  such as YACC and <a href="http://www.antlr.org/">ANTLR</a>, where a parser is built 
  automatically from a grammar specification.  
  Yet, I want it to be extremely small. Small enough to fit in 
  my pocket yet scalable. Scalability is a prime goal. It must be able to practically 
  parse simple grammars such as email addresses to moderately-complex grammars 
  such as XML and perhaps some small- to medium-sized scripting languages. </p>
<p>The result was Spirit. Spirit was a personal project that was conceived when 
  I was doing R&amp;D in Japan. Inspired by the GoF's composite and interpreter 
  patterns, I realized that I can model a recursive-descent parser with hierarchical-object 
  composition of primitives (terminals) and composites (productions). The 
  original version was implemented with run-time polymorphic classes. A parser 
  is generated at run time by feeding in production rule strings such as <tt>&quot;prod 
  ::= {&#145;A&#146; | &#145;B&#146;} &#145;C&#146;;&quot;</tt>. A compile function 
  <i>compiled</i> the parser, dynamically creating a hierarchy of objects and 
  linking semantic actions on the fly. A very early text can be found <a href="http://spirit.sourceforge.net/dl_docs/pre-spirit.htm">here</a>.</p>
<p>The version that we have now is a complete rewrite of the original Spirit parser 
  using expression templates and static polymorphism, inspired by the works of 
  Todd Veldhuizen ("<a 
href="http://www.extreme.indiana.edu/%7Etveldhui/papers/Expression-Templates/exprtmpl.html">Expression 
  Templates</a>", C++ Report, June 1995). Initially, the <i><b>static-Spirit</b></i> 
  version was meant only to replace the core of the original <i><b>dynamic-Spirit</b></i>. 
  Dynamic-spirit needed a parser to implement itself anyway. The original employed 
  a hand-coded recursive-descent parser to parse the input grammar specification 
  strings.</p>
<p>After its initial &quot;open-source&quot; debut in May 2001, static-Spirit 
  became a success. At around November 2001, the Spirit website had an activity 
  percentile of 98%, making it the number one parser tool at Source Forge at the 
  time. Not bad for such a niche project such as a parser library. The &quot;static&quot; 
  portion of Spirit was forgotten and static-Spirit simply became Spirit. The 
  framework soon evolved to acquire more dynamic features.</p>
<p><b>How to use this manual</b><br>
</p>
<p>The Spirit framework is organized in logical modules starting from the core. 
  This documentation provides a user's guide and reference for each module in 
  the framework. A simple and clear code example is worth a hundred lines of documentation; 
  therefore, the user's guide is presented with abundant examples annotated and 
  explained in step-wise manner. The user's guide is based on examples. Lots of 
  them. </p>
<p>As much as possible, forward information (i.e. citing a specific piece of information 
  that has not yet been discussed) is avoided in the user's manual portion of 
  each module. In many cases, though, it is unavoidable that advanced but related 
  topics are interspersed with the normal flow of discussion. To alleviate this 
  problem, topics categorized as <i>&quot;advanced&quot;</i> may be skipped at 
  first reading.</p>
<p>Some icons are used to mark certain topics indicative of their relevance. These 
  icons precede some text to indicate:</p>
