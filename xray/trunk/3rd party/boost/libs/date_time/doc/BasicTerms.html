<h1>Date-Time Terminology</h1>

<p>
<p>
The following are a number of terms relevant to the date-time domain. 
<P>
<P>A taxonomy of temporal types: 
<UL>
  <LI><B>Timepoint</B> -- Specifier for a location in the time continuum. 
  Similar to a number on a ruler. 
  <LI><B>Timelength</B> -- A duration of time unattached to any point on the 
  time continuum. 
  <LI><B>Timeinterval</B> -- A duration of time attached to a specific point in 
  the time continuum. </LI></UL>
<P>And some other terms: 
<UL>
  <LI><B>Accuracy</B> -- A measure of error, the difference between the reading 
  of a clock and the true time. 
  <LI><B>Calendar System</B> -- A system for labeling time points with day level 
  resolution. 
  <LI><B>Clock Device</B> -- A software component (tied to some hardware) that 
  provides the current date or time with respect to a calendar or clock system. 
  <LI><B>Precision</B> -- A measure of repeatability of a clock. 
  <LI><B>Resolution</B> -- A specification of the smallest representable 
  duration (eg: 1 second, 1 century) for a clock/calendar system or temporal 
  type. 
  <LI><B>Stability</B> -- The property of a class which says that the underlying 
  representation (implementation) associated with a particular (abstract) value 
  will never change. 
  <LI><B>Time System</B> -- A system for labeling time points with higher 
  resolution than day-level. </LI></UL>
<P>Some standard date-time terminology: 
<UL>
  <LI><B>Epoch</B> -- Starting time point of a calendar or clock system. 
  <LI><B>DST -- Daylight savings time</B> - a local time adjustment made in some regions during the summer to shift the clock time of the daylight hours
  <LI><B>Time zone</B> -- A region of the earth that provides for a 'local time' 
  defined by DST rules and UT offset. 
  <LI><B>UTC Time</B> -- Coordinated Universal Time - Civil time system as 
  measured at longitude zero. Kept adjusted to earth rotation by use of leap 
  seconds. Also known as Zulu Time. Replaced the similar system known as 
  Greenwich Mean Time. For more see <A 
  href="http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/UT.html">http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/UT.html</A> 

  <LI><B>TAI Time</B> -- A high-accuracy monotonic (need better term) time 
  system measured to .1 microsecond resolution by atomic clocks around the 
  world. Not adjusted to earth rotation. For more see <A 
  href="http://www.bipm.fr/enus/5_Scientific/c_time/time_server.html">http://www.bipm.fr/enus/5_Scientific/c_time/time_server.html</A> 
  </LI></UL>
<P>Some more experimental ones: 
<UL>
  <LI><B>Local Time</B> -- A time measured in a specific location of the 
  universe. 
  <LI><B>Time Label</B> -- A tuple that either completely or partially specifies 
  a specific date-time with respect to a calendar or clock system. This is the 
  year-month-day representation. 
  <LI><B>Adjusting Time Length</B> -- A duration that represents varying 
  physical durations depending on the moment in time. For example, a 1 month 
  duration is typically not a fixed number of days and it depends on the date it 
  is measured from to determine the actual length. </LI></UL>
<P>These are design sorts of terms: 
<UL>
  <LI><B>Generation function</B> -- A function that generates a specific set of 
  time points, lengths, or intervals based on one or more parameters. </LI></UL>
