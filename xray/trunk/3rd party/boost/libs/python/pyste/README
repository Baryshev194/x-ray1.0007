Pyste - Python Semi-Automatic Exporter
======================================

Pyste is a Boost.Python code generator. The user specifies the classes and
functions to be exported using a simple interface file, which following the
Boost.Python's philosophy, is simple Python code. Pyste then uses GCCXML to
parse all the headers and extract the necessary information to automatically
generate C++ code.

The documentation can be found in the file index.html accompaning this README.

Enjoy!

Bugs
====

Pyste is a young tool, so please help it to get better! Send bug reports to
nicodemus@globalite.com.br, accompaining the stack trace in case of exceptions.
If possible, run pyste with --debug, and send the resulting xmls too (pyste
will output a xml file with the same of each header it parsed).
