    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>This is a partial list of projects using Boost.Python. If you are
    using Boost.Python as your Python/C++ binding solution, we'd be proud to
    list your project on this page. Just <a href=
    "mailto:c++-sig@python.org">post</a> a short description of your project
    and how Boost.Python helps you get the job done, and we'll add it to this
    page .</p>

    <h3>Enterprise Software</h3>

    <dl class="page-index">
      <dt><b><a href="http://openwbem.sourceforge.net">OpenWBEM</a></b></dt>

      <dd>
        The OpenWBEM project is an effort to develop an open-source
        implementation of Web Based Enterprise Management suitable for
        commercial and non-commercial application 

        <p><a href="mailto:dnuffer@sco.com">Dan Nuffer</a> writes:</p>

        <blockquote>
          I'm using Boost.Python to wrap the client API of OpenWBEM.This will
          make it easier to do rapid prototyping, testing, and scripting when
          developing management solutions that use WBEM.

    <h3>Financial Analysis</h3>

    <dl class="page-index">
      <dt><b>TSLib</b> - <a href="http://www.fortressinv.com">Fortress
      Investment Group LLC</a></dt>

      <dd>
        Fortress Investment Group has contracted <a href=
        "http://www.boost-consulting.com">Boost Consulting</a> to develop
        core internal financial analysis tools in C++ and to prepare Python
        bindings for them using Boost.Python. 

        <p>Tom Barket of Fortress writes:</p>

        <blockquote>
          We have a large C++ analytical library specialized for research in
          finance and economics, built for speed and mission critical
          stability. Yet Python offers us the flexibility to test out new
          ideas quickly and increase the productivity of our time versus
          working in C++. There are several key features which make Python
          stand out. Its elegance, stability, and breadth of resources on the
          web are all valuable, but the most important is its extensibility,
          due to its open source transparency. Boost.Python makes Python
          extensibility extremely simple and straightforward, yet preserves a
          great deal of power and control.

    <h3>Graphics</h3>

    <dl class="page-index">
      <dt><b><a href=
      "http://www.openscenegraph.org">OpenSceneGraph</a></b></dt>

      <dd><a href="mailto:gideon@computer.org">Gideon May</a> has created a
      set of bindings for OpenSceneGraph, a cross-platform C++/OpenGL library
      for the real-time visualization. You can read the release announcement
      at <a href="http://www.hypereyes.com">www.hypereyes.com</a>. <a href=

      information.<br>

      <dt><a href=
      "http://pythonmagick.procoders.net/"><b>PythonMagick</b></a></dt>

      <dd>PythonMagick binds the <a href=
      "http://www.imagemagick.org">ImageMagick</a> image manipulation library
      to Python.<br>
       &nbsp;</dd>

      <dt><b>HippoDraw</b> - <a href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu">Stanford
      Linear Accelerator Center</a></dt>

      <dd>
        HippoDraw is a data analysis environment consisting of a canvas upon
        which graphs such as histograms, scattter plots, etc, are prsented.
        It has a highly interactive GUI interface, but some things you need
        to do with scripts. HippoDraw can be run as Python extension module
        so that all the manipulation can be done from either Python or the
        GUI.

    <h3>Scientific Computing</h3>

    <dl class="page index">

      <dd>
        CAMFR is a photonics and electromagnetics modelling tool. Python is
        used for computational steering.

      <dt><a href="http://cctbx.sourceforge.net"><b>cctbx - Computational
      Crystallography Toolbox</b></a></dt>

      <dd>
        Computational Crystallography is concerned with the derivation of
        atomic models of crystal structures, given experimental X-ray
        diffraction data. The cctbx is an open-source library of fundamental
        algorithms for crystallographic computations. The core algorithms are
        implemented in C++ and accessed through higher-level Python
        interfaces. 

        <p>The cctbx grew together with Boost.Python and is designed from the
        ground up as a hybrid Python/C++ system. With one minor exception,
        run-time polymorphism is completely handled by Python. C++
        compile-time polymorphism is used to implement performance critical
        algorithms. The Python and C++ layers are seamlessly integrated using
        Boost.Python.</p>

        <p>The SourceForge cctbx project is organized in modules to
        facilitate use in non-crystallographic applications. The scitbx
        module implements a general purpose array family for scientific
        applications and pure C++ ports of FFTPACK and the LBFGS conjugate
        gradient minimizer.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt><a href="http://www.llnl.gov/CASC/emsolve"><b>EMSolve</b></a></dt>

      <dd>EMSolve is a provably stable, charge conserving, and energy
      conserving solver for Maxwell's equations.<br>
       &nbsp;</dd>

      <dt><b><a href="http://cern.ch/gaudi">Gaudi</a></b> and <b><a href=
      "http://cern.ch/Gaudi/RootPython/">RootPython</a></b></dt>

      <dd>
        Gaudi is a framework for particle physics collision data processing
        applications developed in the context of the LHCb and ATLAS
        experiments at CERN. 

        <p><a href="mailto:Pere.Mato@cern.ch">Pere Mato Vila</a> writes:</p>

        <blockquote>
          We are using Boost.Python to provide scripting/interactive
          capability to our framework. We have a module called "GaudiPython"
          implemented using Boost.Python that allows the interaction with any
          framework service or algorithm from python. RootPython also uses
          Boost.Python to provide a generic "gateway" between the <a href=
          "http://root.cern.ch">ROOT</a> framework and python 

          <p>Boost.Python is great. We managed very quickly to interface our
          framework to python, which is great language. We are trying to
          facilitate to our physicists (end-users) a rapid analysis
          application development environment based on python. For that,
          Boost.Python plays and essential role.</p>
