By now you should know how to use Boost.Python to call your C++ code from
Python. However, sometimes you may need to do the reverse: call Python code
from the C++-side. This requires you to <i>embed</i> the Python interpreter
into your C++ program.</p>
<p>
Currently, Boost.Python does not directly support everything you'll need
when embedding. Therefore you'll need to use the
<a href="http://www.python.org/doc/current/api/api.html">
Python/C API</a> to fill in
the gaps. However, Boost.Python already makes embedding a lot easier and,
in a future version, it may become unnecessary to touch the Python/C API at
all. So stay tuned... <img src="theme/smiley.gif"></img></p>
<a name="building_embedded_programs"></a><h2>Building embedded programs</h2><p>
To be able to use embedding in your programs, they have to be linked to
both Boost.Python's and Python's static link library.</p>
<p>
Boost.Python's static link library comes in two variants. Both are located
in Boost's <tt>/libs/python/build/bin-stage</tt> subdirectory. On Windows, the
variants are called <tt>boost_python.lib</tt> (for release builds) and
<tt>boost_python_debug.lib</tt> (for debugging). If you can't find the
libraries, you probably haven't built Boost.Python yet. See <a
href="../../building.html">Building and Testing</a> on how to do
this.</p>
<p>
Python's static link library can be found in the <tt>/libs</tt> subdirectory of
your Python directory. On Windows it is called pythonXY.lib where X.Y is
your major Python version number.</p>
<p>
Additionally, Python's <tt>/include</tt> subdirectory has to be added to your
include path.</p>
<p>
In a Jamfile, all the above boils down to:</p>
<code><pre>
    projectroot c:\projects\embedded_program ; # location of the program

    # bring in the rules for python
    SEARCH on python.jam = $(BOOST_BUILD_PATH) ;
    include python.jam ;

    exe embedded_program # name of the executable
      : #sources
         embedded_program.cpp
      : # requirements
         &lt;find-library&gt;boost_python &lt;library-path&gt;c:\boost\libs\python
      $(PYTHON_PROPERTIES)
        &lt;library-path&gt;$(PYTHON_LIB_PATH)
        &lt;find-library&gt;$(PYTHON_EMBEDDED_LIBRARY) ;
</pre></code><a name="getting_started"></a><h2>Getting started</h2><p>
Being able to build is nice, but there is nothing to build yet. Embedding
the Python interpreter into one of your C++ programs requires these 4
steps:</p>
<ol><li>#include <tt>&lt;boost/python.hpp&gt;</tt><br><br></li><li>Call <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/current/api/initialization.html#l2h-652">
Py_Initialize</a>() to start the interpreter and create the <tt>__main__</tt> module.<br><br></li><li>Call other Python C API routines to use the interpreter.<br><br></li><li>Call <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/current/api/initialization.html#l2h-656">
Py_Finalize</a>() to stop the interpreter and release its resources.</li></ol><p>
(Of course, there can be other C++ code between all of these steps.)</p>
