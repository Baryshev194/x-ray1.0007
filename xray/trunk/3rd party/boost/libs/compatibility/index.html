<h1>Boost.Compatibilty library</h1>

<p>
This library provides workarounds which allow the other Boost libraries
to be used on otherwise non-conforming platforms. We hope that it will
be possible to remove this library at some time in the future as
standard library suppliers become more conforming.

<h2>
Missing C++ standard library CXX headers (e.g &lt;cstdio&gt;) workaround</h2>

<p>
The Python script:
<tt><a href="generate_cpp_c_headers.py">generate_cpp_c_headers.py</a> </tt>creates a full set of C++ C header files
(e.g. &lt;cstdio&gt;) that are missing on some platforms.
The header files created by this script reside in the directory <tt><a href="../../boost/compatibility/cpp_c_headers/">boost/compatibility/cpp_c_headers</a></tt>.
To use the header files, add this directory to the include
file search path. For example:

<pre>
cxx -I/usr/local/boost/boost/compatibility/cpp_c_headers ...
</pre>

<p>
Supported platforms are:
<ul>
<li>Compaq Alpha, RedHat 6.2 Linux, Compaq C++ V6.3 (cxx)
<li>Compaq Alpha, Tru64 Unix V5.0, Compaq C++ V6.2 (cxx)
<li>Silicon Graphics, IRIX 6.5, MIPSpro Compilers: Version 7.3.1.1m (CC)
</ul>

<p>
There are more powerful alternatives to using
the Boost.Compatibility library CXX headers, e.g.
<a href="http://www.stlport.org/">STLport</a> or
<a href="http://www-pat.fnal.gov/personal/wb/boost/">ISOCXX</a>.
However, in contrast to these alternatives, the
<tt>generate_cpp_c_headers.py</tt> script is very light-weight (less
than 100 non-comment lines of Python code), much less ambitious,
significantly easier to maintain and therefore more suitable as an interim workaround.

<h2>
Missing C++ standard library &lt;limits&gt; header workaround <a href="../../boost/limits.hpp">boost/limits.hpp</a></h2>
<p>Several Boost libraries require the standard library's &lt;limits&gt; header,
yet this header is not always supplied by non-conforming compilers and
libraries.&nbsp; Header <a href="../../boost/limits.hpp">boost/limits.hpp</a>
simply includes the standard library &lt;limits&gt; header if available,
otherwise includes <a href="../../boost/detail/limits.hpp">boost/detail/limits.hpp</a>.&nbsp;
BOOST_NO_LIMITS from <a href="../config/config.htm">boost/config.hpp</a> is used
to determine &lt;limits&gt; availability.
<p>Note also the test program <a href="../config/test/limits_test.cpp">limits_test.cpp</a>
