	<h4>Named External Argument</h4>
	<div>
		A <i>named external argument</i> is an argument to a macro that is <i>included</i>.&nbsp;
		There is no way to pass arguments to a file directly, so they must be passed to files in the form of macros with known names that are defined by the user.&nbsp;
		Every time that the library uses this idiom, the file that is included automatically undefines the macro in order to better simulate <i>normal</i> parameters.
