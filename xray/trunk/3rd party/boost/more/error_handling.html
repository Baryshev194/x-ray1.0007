    <title>Error and Exception Handling</title>

    <h1>Error and Exception Handling</h1>

    <h2>References</h2>

    <p>The following paper is a good introduction to some of the issues of
    writing robust generic components:

    <h2>Guidelines</h2>

    <h3>When should I use exceptions?</h3>

    <p>The simple answer is: ``whenever the semantic and performance
    characteristics of exceptions are appropriate.''

    <p>An oft-cited guideline is to ask yourself the question ``is this an
    exceptional (or unexpected) situation?'' This guideline has an attractive
    ring to it, but is usually a mistake. The problem is that one person's
    ``exceptional'' is another's ``expected'': when you really look at the
    terms carefully, the distinction evaporates and you're left with no
    guideline. After all, if you check for an error condition, then in some
    sense you expect it to happen, or the check is wasted code.

    <p>A more appropriate question to ask is: ``do we want stack unwinding
    here?'' Because actually handling an exception is likely to be
    significantly slower than executing mainline code, you should also ask:
    ``Can I afford stack unwinding here?'' For example, a desktop application
    performing a long computation might periodically check to see whether the
    user had pressed a cancel button. Throwing an exception could allow the
    operation to be cancelled gracefully. On the other hand, it would probably
    be inappropriate to throw and <i>handle</i> exceptions in the inner loop of
    this computation because that would have a significant performance impact.

    <h3>What About Programmer Errors?</h3>

    <p>As a developer, if I have violated a precondition of a library I'm
    using, I don't want stack unwinding. What I want is a core dump or the
    equivalent - a way to inspect the state of the program at the exact point
    where the problem was detected. That usually means <tt>assert()</tt> or
    something like it.

    <p>Sometimes it is neccessary to have resilient APIs which can stand up to
    nearly any kind of client abuse, but there is usually a significant cost to
    this approach. For example, it usually requires that each object used by a
    client be tracked so that it can be checked for validity. If you need that
    sort of protection, it can usually be provided as a layer on top of a
    simpler API. Beware half-measures, though. An API which promises resilience
    against some, but not all abuse is an invitation to disaster. Clients will
    begin to rely on the protection and their expectations will grow to cover
    unprotected parts of the interface.

    <p><b>Note for Windows developers</b>: unfortunately, the native
    exception-handling used by most Windows compilers actually throws an
    exception when you use <tt>assert()</tt>. Actually, this is true of other
    programmer errors such as segmentation faults and divide-by-zero errors.
    One problem with this is that if you use JIT (Just In Time) debugging,
    there will be collateral exception-unwinding before the debugger comes up.
    Fortunately, there is a simple but little-known workaround, which is to use
    the following incantation:

    <blockquote>
<pre>
extern "C" void straight_to_debugger(unsigned int, EXCEPTION_POINTERS*)
{
    throw;
}
extern "C" void (*old_translator)(unsigned, EXCEPTION_POINTERS*)
         = _set_se_translator(straight_to_debugger);
</pre>
    </blockquote>
