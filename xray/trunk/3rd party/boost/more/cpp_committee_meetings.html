<h1>C++ Committee Meeting FAQ for Boost Members</h1>
<p><b>Who can attend C++ Committee meetings?</b> Members of 
J16 (the INCITS/ANSI committee) or of a WG21 (ISO) member country committee 
(&quot;national body&quot; in 
ISO-speak). <a href="http://www.ncits.org/">
INCITS</a> has broadened&nbsp; J16 membership requirements so anyone can 
join, regardless of nationality or employer.</p>
<p>In addition, a small number of &quot;technical experts&quot; who are not committee 
members can also attend meetings. The &quot;technical expert&quot; umbrella is broad enough to cover 
the 
Boost members who attend meetings.</p>
<p><b>When and where is the next meeting?</b> See a general
<a href="http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/meetings">list of locations and 
dates</a>. Detailed information about a particular meeting, including hotel 
information, is usually provided in a paper appearing in the <a href="#Mailing">
pre- or post-meeting mailing</a> for the prior meeting. You will have to go to 
the committee's <a href="http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/">Papers 
web page</a> and search a bit.</p>
<p><b>Is there a fee for attending meetings?</b> No, but there can be a lot of 
incidental expenses like travel, lodging, and meals, and there is a $US 800 a 
year INCITS fee to become a voting member.</p>
<p><b>What is the schedule?</b>&nbsp; The meetings start at 9:00AM on 
Monday, and 8:30AM other days, unless otherwise announced. It is best to arrive 
a half-hour early to grab a good seat, some coffee, tea, or donuts, and to say 
hello to people. (There is also a Sunday evening a WG21 administrative meeting, 
which is closed except to delegates from national bodies.)</p>
<p>The Friday meeting&nbsp; is generally over by 11:00AM. Because the Friday 
meeting is for formal votes only, it is primarily of interest only to committee 
members.</p>
<p>Sometimes there are evening technical sessions; the details aren't 
usually available until the Monday morning meeting.&nbsp; There may be a 
reception one evening, and, yes, significant others are 
invited. Again, details usually&nbsp;become available Monday morning.</p>
<p><b>What actually happens at the meetings?</b> Monday morning an hour or two 
is spent in full committee on administrivia, and then the committee breaks up 
into working groups (Core, Library, and Enhancements). The full committee also 
gets together later in the week to hear working group progress reports.</p>
<p>The working groups are where most technical activities take place.&nbsp; Each 
active issue that appears on an issues list is discussed, as are papers from the 
mailing. Most issues are non-controversial and disposed of in a few minutes. 
Technical discussions are often led by long-term committee members, often 
referring to past decisions or longstanding working group practice. Sometimes a 
controversy erupts. It takes first-time attendees awhile to understand the 
discussions and how decisions are actually made. The working group chairperson 
moderates.</p>
<p>Sometimes straw polls are taken. In a straw poll anyone attending can vote, 
in contrast to the formal votes taken by the full committee, where only voting 
members can vote.</p>
<p>Lunch break is an hour and a half.&nbsp; Informal subgroups often lunch 
together; a lot of technical problems are discussed or actually solved at lunch, 
or later at dinner. In many ways these discussions involving only a few people 
are the most interesting. Sometimes during the regular meetings, a working group 
chair will break off a sub-group to tackle a difficult problem. </p>
<p><b>Do I have to stay at the main hotel?</b> No, and committee members on 
tight budgets often stay at other, cheaper, hotels. (The main hotels are usually 
chosen because they have large meeting rooms available, and thus tend to be pricey.) 
The advantage of staying at the main hotel is that it is then easier to 
participate in the off-line discussions which can be at least as interesting 
as what actually happens in the scheduled meetings.</p>
<p><b>What do people wear at meetings?</b>&nbsp; Programmer casual. No neckties 
to be seen. </p>
<p><b>What should I bring to a meeting?</b> It is very handy to have a laptop 
computer along. There is normally a little network with Internet connectivity, 
so bring your Ethernet adapter and a longish cable. There may be 802.11b, but 
don't bet on it.</p>
<p><b>What should I do to prepare for a meeting?</b> It is helpful to have 
downloaded the mailing or individual papers for the 
meeting, and read any papers you are interested in. Familiarize yourself with 
the issues lists if you haven't done so already. Decide which of the working 
groups you want to attend.</p>
<p><b>What is a &quot;<a name="Paper">Paper</a>&quot;?</b> An electronic document containing issues, 
proposals, or anything else the committee is interested in. Very little gets 
discussed at a meeting, much less acted upon, unless it is presented in a paper.&nbsp;
<a href="http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/">Papers are available</a> 
to anyone. Papers don't just appear randomly; they become available four times a 
year, before and after each meeting. Committee members often refer to a paper by 
saying what mailing it was in: &quot;See the pre-Redmond mailing.&quot;</p>
<p><b>What is a &quot;<a name="Mailing">Mailing</a>&quot;?</b> A mailing is the 
set of papers prepared four times a year before and after each meeting.&nbsp; It 
is physically just a
<a href="http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/mailings/">.zip or .gz</a> 
archive of 
all the papers for a meeting. Although the mailing's archive file itself is only available to committee members and technical 
experts, the contents (except copies of the standard) are available to the 
general public as individual papers. The ways of ISO are 
inscrutable.</p>
<p><b>What is a &quot;Reflector&quot;?</b> The committee's mailing lists are 
called &quot;reflectors&quot;. There are a number of them; &quot;all&quot;, &quot;core&quot;, &quot;lib&quot;, and &quot;ext&quot; 
are the main ones. As a courtesy, Boost technical experts can be added to 
committee reflectors at the request of a committee member. </p>
