    <h1>Boost Download and Installation</h1>
    The boost libraries are intended for easy download and <a href=
    "#Installation">installation</a>; many libraries require nothing more
    that downloading and unpacking to be ready for use, including full
    documentation.&nbsp; When required, see <a href=
    "../tools/build/index.html">Building Boost Libraries</a> to create object
    libraries. 

    <h2>Download</h2>
    <p>Click here to <b>
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7586">
    <font size="4">download releases from SourceForge</font></a></b>. </p>
    <p>The Boost release includes all of the libraries and other material from 
    the web site. It is available in <a href="#.zip">ZIP</a> or
    <a href="#.tar.gz">TAR.GZ</a> formats. Past releases are also available.</p>
    It is also possible to download current snapshots of work-in-progress from 
    Boost's <a href="#CVS">CVS repository</a>.<h3><a name=".zip">.zip</a> file</h3>
    The .zip format is widely supported by both free decoders and commercial
    compress/archive utilities. If you don't already have a .zip file
    decoder, download one from the <a href=
    "http://www.info-zip.org/">Info-ZIP</a> web site, which supplies versions
    for many operating systems. 

    <p>Text file line endings in the .zip file are as supplied by each
    library developer.&nbsp; This works fine for Windows, but not for
    Unix/Linux.&nbsp; The .tar.gz file supplies Unix/Linux friendly line
    endings.</p>

    <h3><a name=".tar.gz">.tar.gz</a> file</h3>
    The .tar.gz format is widely supported on Unix/Linux platforms. Some
    Windows compress/archive utilities can read the format as well.&nbsp;
    Because the gzip format compresses the archive as a single file rather
    than compressing each file individually, the .tar.gz file is smaller that
    the .zip file. 

    <p>Text file line endings in the .tar.gz file have been converted to
    newlines for ease of use on Unix/Linux platforms.</p>

    <h2>Boost <a name="CVS">CVS</a> Repository</h2>

    <p>All Boost files, including the entire distribution tree including web
    site HTML is maintained in a CVS repository. Command line, GUI, or browser 
    access is available.</p>

    <h3>Boost CVS access via command line or graphical clients</h3>
    For those who have CVS clients installed, the libraries are also
    available from the public <a href=
    "http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=7586">Boost CVS repository</a>. Free 
    command line clients (often already installed on Linux/Unix systems) are 
    available for many systems, and free GUI clients are available for Windows, 
    Mac, and other systems.<p>See the much improved
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/docman/?group_id=1">CVS documentation</a> 
    (Section F) from SourceForge, which includes links to the home pages for various 
    GUI and command line clients.</p>

    <p>The general procedure for command-line clients is something like
    this:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.boost.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/boost
      login</code><br>
      [Hit &lt;return&gt; when it asks for a password]<br>
      <code>cvs -z3
      -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.boost.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/boost checkout
      boost<br>
       cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.boost.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/boost
      logout</code>
    </blockquote>
    Read the manual for your CVS client for further information. 

    <p>This access is read-only; if you are a library author and wish to have
    CVS write access, please contact one of the <a href=
    "mailto:boost-owner@yahoogroups.com">moderators</a>.</p>

    <h3>Boost CVS access via web <a name="Browser">Browser</a></h3>
    For access to the CVS archive from any modern web browser, you can also
    use the <a href=
    "http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/boost/boost/">web
    browser&nbsp; interface</a>.&nbsp; Try one of the color diffs to see how
    a file has changed over time. 

    <h2><a name="Installation">Installation</a></h2>
    Boost does not yet have a standardized installation process. There has
    been some interest in developing one; as of this writing <a href=
    "../people/william_kempf.htm">Bill Kempf</a> has volunteered to
    coordinate and is gathering volunteers. If you have expertise in this
    area (particularly cross-platform expertise), and you would like to
    contribute, please announce your availability on the <a href=
    "http://lists.boost.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/boost-install">Boost
    Install</a> mailing list. 

    <p>That said, preparing to use Boost in a development project is
    relatively straightforward. Most boost libraries are implemented entirely
    within their header files. The only preparation for their use is to add
    the boost root directory to your compiler's list of
    <code>#include&lt;...&gt;</code> search paths. For example, using Windows
    2000, if you have unzipped release 1.28.0 from boost_all.zip into the top
    level directory of your C drive, adding '-Ic:/boost_1_28_0' to the
    command line of most compilers is sufficient.</p>

    <p>The <a href="../libs/python/doc/index.html">Python</a>, <a href=
    "../libs/regex/index.htm">Regex</a>, and <a href=
    "../libs/thread/doc/index.html">Threads</a> libraries are implemented in
    part as separate source files, and thus require compilation before use.
    See <a href="../tools/build/index.html">Building Boost Libraries</a> for
    an automatic tool to prepare such libraries. Some of the individual
    libraries also include make and/or project files for various compilers,
    but <em>every</em> library with a built component includes the neccessary
    <code>Jamfile</code> for building with <a href=
    "../tools/build/index.html">Boost.Build</a>, our standard build tool.</p>
