I. Compiling FT Jam:
--------------------

  1. With a previous version of Jam:
  ----------------------------------
  
  The easiest way to compile Jam is to use a previous version of the
  program. If you already have one installed on your system, simply
  type "jam" in this directory.
  
  This will create a new executable named "jam" or "jam.exe", located
  in a new system-dependent directory, whose name can be:
  
     bin.ntx86\jam.exe
     bin.linux86\jam
     etc..
     

  2. Without jam:
  ---------------
  
  If you don't have a jam binary installed, you can still compile the
  program using one of these methods:
  
    - on Unix systems, simply type "make" to use the "Makefile" provided
      in this directory. This should work flawlessly
      
    - on other systems, you can also modify the content of "Makefile"
      to adapt it to your OS. Simply uncomment the lines specific to
      your system, and invoke your make tool


  Note that the Makefile is used to build a boot-strap version of jam,
  called "jam0". Once it is built, the "jam0" executable is called to
  re-build itself.
  
  If this second pass doesn't work, this is probably because you didn't
  set some environment variable that indicates which compiler to use to
  Jam. Read the Jam documentation for more information on this.. 


  
  3. With toolset-specific makefiles:
  -----------------------------------
  
  You can also use one of the Makefiles located in the "builds"
  directory. Here's what you need to type on the command line,
  depending on your system and compiler:
  
  
  a. Windows + Visual C++:
  
       set VISUALC=""/install/path/to/visual/compiler""
       set JAM_TOOLSET=VISUALC
       nmake -f builds\win32-visualc.mk
                           
                           
  b. Windows + Borland C++: (be sure to use the Borland "make" tool)

        set BORLANDC=""/install/path/to/borland/compiler""
        set JAM_TOOLSET=BORLANDC
        make -f builds\win32-borlandc.mk   


  c. Windows + Mingw (gcc):

        set MINGW=""/install/path/to/gcc/compiler""
        set JAM_TOOLSET=MINGW
        make -f builds\win32-gcc.mk   


  WE DO NOT PROVIDE PROJECT FILES FOR ANY SPECIFIC COMPILER/TOOLSET
 
      


II. Installation:
-----------------

  For now, we do not provide any sophisticated
  installation pass. Simply copy the new jam executable
  to any directory in your current path.. and start
  using it !!
  

III. Default files:
-------------------

  All default files for Jam are compiled within the
  executable itself.
  
  There are no special configuration directory to
  place global or user preferences. Until further
  notice, all defaults can only be changed by using
  command line switches and setting environment
  variables..


IV. Windows and OS/2 Binary packages:
-------------------------------------

  It's possible to create zip files of the binaries
  on Windows and OS/2 system by following these simple
  steps (you need to have the "zip" utility in your
  path !!):
  
    1. build jam
    2. strip the jam.exe executable in bin.ntx86 when
       possible
    3. call "jam package"
    
  you should see a file named "ftjam-xxxxx-win32.zip"
  or "ftjam-xxxxx-os2.zip" in the current directory,
  as well as "ftjam-xxxxx.zip" (containing the sources)


Good luck,
