Practical considerations</h2></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2807572"></a>7.1. Performance</h3></div></div><p>In theory, all overhead of using STL algorithms and lambda functors 
compared to hand written loops can be optimized away, just as the overhead 
from standard STL function objects and binders can.

Depending on the compiler, this can also be true in practice.
We ran two tests with the GCC 3.0.4 compiler on 1.5 GHz Intel Pentium 4.
The optimization flag -03 was used.
</p><p>
In the first test we compared lambda functors against explicitly written 
function objects. 
We used both of these styles to define unary functions which multiply the
argument repeatedly by itself. 
We started with the identity function, going up to 
x<sup>5</sup>.
The expressions were called inside a <tt>std::transform</tt> loop, 
reading the argument from one <tt>std::vector&lt;int&gt;</tt> 
and placing the result into another.
The length of the vectors was 100 elements.
The running times are listed in 
<a href="ar01s07.html#table:increasing_arithmetic_test" title="Table 3. Test 1. CPU time of expressions with integer multiplication written as a lambda expression and as a traditional hand-coded function object class. 
The running times are expressed in arbitrary units.">Table 3</a>.

We can observe that there is no significant difference between the
two approaches.
</p><p>
In the second test we again used <tt>std::transform</tt> to 
perform an operation to each element in a 100-element long vector.
This time the element type of the vectors was <tt>double</tt>
and we started with very simple arithmetic expressions and moved to 
more complex ones.
The running times are listed in <a href="ar01s07.html#table:ll_vs_stl_test" title="Table 4. Test 2. CPU time of arithmetic expressions written as lambda 
expressions, as classic STL unnamed functions (using compose2, bind1st etc.) and as traditional hand-coded function object classes. 
Using BLL terminology, 
a and b are bound arguments in the expressions, and x is open. 
All variables were of types double.
The running times are expressed in arbitrary units.">Table 4</a>.

Here, we also included classic STL style unnamed functions into tests.
We do not show these expressions, as they get rather complex. 
For example, the
last expression in <a href="ar01s07.html#table:ll_vs_stl_test" title="Table 4. Test 2. CPU time of arithmetic expressions written as lambda 
expressions, as classic STL unnamed functions (using compose2, bind1st etc.) and as traditional hand-coded function object classes. 
Using BLL terminology, 
a and b are bound arguments in the expressions, and x is open. 
All variables were of types double.
The running times are expressed in arbitrary units.">Table 4</a> written with
classic STL tools contains 7 calls to <tt>compose2</tt>, 
8 calls to <tt>bind1st</tt>
and altogether 14 constructor invocations for creating 
<tt>multiplies</tt>, <tt>minus</tt> 
and <tt>plus</tt> objects.

In this test the BLL expressions are a little slower (roughly 10% on average,
less than 14% in all cases)
than the corresponding hand-written function objects.
The performance hit is a bit greater with classic STL expressions,
up to 27% for the simplest expressios.
</p><p>
The tests suggest that the BLL does not introduce a loss of performance 
compared to STL function objects.  
With a reasonable optimizing compiler, one should expect the performance characteristics be comparable to using classic STL.
Moreover, with simple expressions the performance can be expected to be close
to that of explicitly written function objects.



Note however, that evaluating a lambda functor consist of a sequence of calls to small functions that are declared inline. 
If the compiler fails to actually expand these functions inline, 
the performance can suffer. 
The running time can more than double if this happens.
Although the above tests do not include such an expression, we have experienced
this for some seemingly simple expressions.

</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2808065"></a>7.2. About compiling</h3></div></div><p>The BLL uses templates rather heavily, performing numerous recursive instantiations of the same templates. 
This has (at least) three implications:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
While it is possible to write incredibly complex lambda expressions, it probably isn't a good idea. 
Compiling such expressions may end up requiring a lot of memory 
at compile time, and being slow to compile.
</p></li><li><p>
The types of lambda functors that result from even the simplest lambda expressions are cryptic. 
Usually the programmer doesn't need to deal with the lambda functor the types at all, but in the case of an error in a lambda expression, the compiler usually outputs the types of the lambda functors involved. 
This can make the error messages very long and difficult to interpret, particularly if the compiler outputs the whole chain of template instantiations.
</p></li><li><p>
The C++ Standard suggests a template nesting level of 17 to help detect infinite recursion. 
Complex lambda templates can easily exceed this limit. 
Most compilers allow a greater number of nested templates, but commonly require the limit explicitly increased with a command line argument.
