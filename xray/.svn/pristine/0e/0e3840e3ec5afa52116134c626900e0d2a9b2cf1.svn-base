      Jens Maurer is a software developer from Germany who lives close to 
      Frankfurt/Main. He was born in 1973 and hasn't died yet.</p>
    <p>He has worked for a multimedia company programming home-banking applications, 
      CGI scripts and Java applications. He also helped program some simulation 
      systems for long-term decision support to aid businessmen in arguing about 
      company investments.</p>
    <p>He is neither married nor does he have a girl friend, but asked his colleagues 
      to find one for him.</p>
    <p>In his spare time, he likes visiting foreign countries but dislikes getting 
      there in uncomfortable airplane seats. On random week-ends, he enjoys 
      participating in historic dance courses (without a costume, of course). 
      Sometimes, he needs fresh air and goes for a walk.&nbsp;</p>
