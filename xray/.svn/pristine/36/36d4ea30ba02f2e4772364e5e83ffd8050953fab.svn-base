      Bill Kempf lives in Omaha, NE with his wife Bonnie, his cat Dexter and his two 
      Chinchillas, Chimney and Minuet. He married on Oct. 30, 1999 where he and his 
      wife held a Halloween costume reception. If that doesn't give you an idea of 
      what kind of guy he is, nothing will.</p>
    <p>Bill graduated from Doane, a small private college in Nebraska in 1992 with a 
      B.S. in Computer Science/Math. Being in the wrong place at the wrong time he 
      had to take a job as the only person in an IS shop for a local affiliate of the 
      Bunge Grain Company. In 1995 he moved on to a job as a software engineer for 
      First Data Resources where he worked on client/server financial applications.</p>
