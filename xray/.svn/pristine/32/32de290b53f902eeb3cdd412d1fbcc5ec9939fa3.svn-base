Welcome to the evaluation of our C++ matrix library.

Installation:
Extract the zip-file to a (new) directory of your choice. Workspace and
project files for MSVC and Jamfiles for the Boost build system are contained
within the archive.

Tests and benchmarks:
Test1 contains a couple of basic tests for dense vectors and matrices.
Test2 demonstrates how to emulate BLAS with this matrix library.
Test3 contains a couple of basic tests for sparse vectors and matrices.
Test4 contains a couple of basic tests for banded matrices.
Test5 contains a couple of basic tests for triangular matrices.
Test6 contains a couple of basic tests for symmetric matrices.
Test7 contains a couple of basic tests for dense vectors and matrices of
boost::numeric::interval(s).
Bench1 measures the abstraction penalty using certain dense matrix and vector
operations.
Bench2 measures the performance of sparse matrix and vector operations.
Bench3 measures the performance of vector and matrix proxy's operations.
Bench4 measures the abstraction penalty using certain dense matrix and vector
operations with boost::numeric::interval(s).
