    <p><img border="0" src="http://boost.sourceforge.net/photos/vesa_karvonen.jpg" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="5" width="100" height="133">If 
      we are to believe MBTI tests, Vesa is an <a href="http://fuzzy.snakeden.org/intj/">
        INTJ</a>. He has been like that probably since late 1978-1979, because, 
      according to some sources, it takes 2-3 years to develop the basic temperament. 
      Previously he saw himself mostly as a &quot;builder of systems&quot; and 
      &quot;applier of theoretical models&quot;, but nowadays he is beginning to see 
      the &quot;mastermind&quot; aspect of his personality. As a 
      &quot;Free-Thinker&quot;, his mind hardly ever rests.</p>
    <p>Vesa enjoys healthy and sustainable ways of life. He is a vegetarian and likes 
      cooking. Exercise is a daily part of his life - he needs to be in good shape in 
      order to sit all day in work. He likes going to the gym, swimming, spinning, 
      running, roller skating, etc... He also practices dancing.</p>
    <p>For the past years, he has been working in a small <a hreF="http://www.housemarque.com">
        company</a> that develops console games. His role is the development of 
      software technology, such as class libraries, frameworks and tools, for making 
      games. He doesn't see himself as a game or a graphics programmer, although he 
      has been involved in quite a few such projects. For the past few years, most of 
      his programming has been in C++, but recently he has also enjoyed writing some 
      Ocaml.</p>
    <p>He likes buying technical books using the company credit card, but lately he 
      hasn't had the time to read as much as he would like (hopefully this changes 
      soon). He likes reading (a lot) computer science and software engineering, but 
      also psychology, philosophy and various self-help books, because he knows that 
      all the really hard problems are social - not technical. Fantasy is also close 
      to his heart.</p>
    <p>Vesa is a bit ambivalent about his university studies. He is a self-educated 
      programmer and has experience ranging from bit twiddling to generative 
      programming and also leading of small teams. Like many of his close colleagues, 
      he sees that the depth of computer science education, at least in Finland, is, 
      frankly, insufficient. He'll probably complete his studies some day, because 
      sadly most people respect authority by rank, title or publication far more than 
      he does.</p>
    <p>Vesa is an eXtreme Programmer. He has found out that in order for pair 
      programming to work, both pairs must share a similar level of experience and 
      must be both willing and able to externalize their thoughts. If he is sometimes 
      forced to stop refactoring, he'll probably quit his job. He thinks that 
      optimization, including improving readability and simplifying structure, is the 
      root of all fun in programming. He dislikes writing documentation and reports 
      that are never read.</p>
    <p>One of his friends coerced him to use the image that you see on this page. The 
      image was scanned from a rather worn out picture taken by an ex-girlfriend and 
      is probably the only picture of Vesa having his natural smile. Vesa is neither 
      married nor engaged, but just recently he met a very nice girl... While 
      programming is interesting and fun, it is love that really makes him happy. ;)</p>
