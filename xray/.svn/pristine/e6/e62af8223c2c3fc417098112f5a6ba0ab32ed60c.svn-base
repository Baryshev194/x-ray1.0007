<p>Special thanks to </p>
<p><b>Dan Nuffer</b> for his work on lexers, parse trees, ASTs, XML parsers, the 
  multi-pass iterator as well as administering Spirit's site, editing, maintaining 
  the CVS and doing the releases plus a zillion of other chores that were almost 
  taken for granted. </p>
<p><b>Hartmut Kaiser</b> for his work on the C parser, the work on the C/C++ preprocessor, 
  utility parsers, the original port to Intel 5.0, various work on Phoenix, porting 
  to v1.5, the meta-parsers, the grouping-parsers, extensive testing and painstaking 
  attention to details.</p>
<p><b>Martin Wille</b> who improved grammar multi thread safety, contributed the 
  eol_p parser, the dynamic parsers, documentation and for taking an active role 
  in almost every aspect from brainstorming and design to coding.</p>
<p><b>Martijn W. Van Der Lee</b> our Web site administrator and for contributing 
  the RFC821 parser<b>.</b></p>
<p><b>Juan Carlos Arevalo-Baeza (JCAB) </b>for his work on the C++ parser, the 
  line counting iterator, ports to v1.5 and keeping the mailing list discussions 
  alive and kicking.</p>
<p><b>Raghavendra Satish </b>for doing the original v1.3 port to VC++ and his 
  work on Phoenix.</p>
<p><b>Noah Stein</b> for following up and helping Ragav on the VC++ ports.</p>
<p><b>Hakki Dogusan</b>, for his original v1.0 Pascal parser.</p>
<p><b>John (EBo) David</b> for his work on the VM and watching over my shoulder 
  as I code giving the impression of distance eXtreme programming.</p>
<p><b>Chris Uzdavinis</b> for feeding in comments and valuable suggestions as 
  well as editing the documentation.</p>
<p><b>Carsten Stoll</b>, for his work on dynamic parsers.</p>
<p><b>Andy Elvey</b> and his conifer parser.</p>
<p><b>Bruce Florman</b>, who did the original v1.0 port to VC++.</p>
<p><b>Jeff Westfahl </b>for porting the loop parsers to v1.5 and contributing 
  the file iterator.</p>
<p><b>Peter Simons</b> for the RFC date parser example and tutorial plus helping 
  out with some nitty gritty details.</p>
<p><b>Markus Sch&ouml;pflin</b> for suggesting the end_p parser and lots of other 
  nifty things and his active presence in the mailing list.</p>
<p><b>Doug Gregor</b> for mentoring and his ability to see things that others 
  don't. </p>
<p><strong>David Abrahams</strong> for giving me a job that allows me to still 
  work on Spirit, plus countless advice and help on C++ and specifically template 
  metaprogramming.</p>
<p><strong>Aleksey Gurtovoy</strong> for his MPL library from which I stole many 
  metaprogramming tricks especially for less conforming compilers such as Borland 
  and VC6/7.</p>
<p><strong>Gustavo Guerra</strong> for his last minute review of Spirit and constant 
  feedback, plus patches here and there (e.g. proposing the new dot behavior of 
  the real numerics parsers).</p>
<p><strong>Nicola Musatti, Paul Snively, Alisdair Meredith </strong>and<strong> 
  Hugo Duncan </strong> for testing and sending in various patches.</p>
<p><strong>Steve Rowe</strong> for his splendid work on the TSTs that will soon
